# Force email verification

This rule will only allow access users that have verified their emails.
Note that it might be a better UX to make this verification from your application.

If you are using [Lock](https://auth0.com/docs/lock), the default behavior is to log in a user immediately after they have signed up.
To prevent this from immediately displaying an error to the user, you can pass the following option to `lock.show()` or similar: `loginAfterSignup: false`.
If you are using [auth0.js](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/auth0js), the equivalent option is `auto_login: false`.

```js
function (user, context, callback) {
  if (!user.email_verified) {
    return callback(new UnauthorizedError('Please verify your email before logging in.'));
  } else {
    return callback(null, user, context);
  }
}
```
